**Project Description**
  This game is the famous snakes and ladders game. I really enjoyed playing that game when I was younger and the logic is fairly simple. Basically, 2-4 people can play a   and the point of the game is to get to the end goal. You roll two dice to see how many spaces you can move. Along the way to the end goal, there are snakes and there     are ladders. If you land on a space with a ladder, you can move up to where the top of the ladder is. However, if you land on a space with a snake, you move down to     where the tail of the snake is. The player who reaches the end goal (100th space) first wins.
