**Project Description**
  This game is the famous snakes and ladders game. I really enjoyed playing that game when I was younger and the logic is fairly simple. Basically, 2-4 people can play a   and the point of the game is to get to the end goal. You roll two dice to see how many spaces you can move. Along the way to the end goal, there are snakes and there     are ladders. If you land on a space with a ladder, you can move up to where the top of the ladder is. However, if you land on a space with a snake, you move down to     where the tail of the snake is. The player who reaches the end goal (100th space) first wins.

**Game Logic**
  - start the game
  - press button to roll the dice
  - character moves number of spaces equal to what is on the dice
  - if character lands on ladder, they will move up to respective ladder space
  - if character lands on snake, they will move down to respective snake tail space
  - if character reaches 100th space, game is over and they win.
 
**Deliverables**
  MVP:
    - one player has to roll one dice to see if they can reach the 100th space
    - ladder moves them up
    - snake moves them down
    
 Post-MVP Plans:
    - add a second player
    - add a second dice
    - the player has to roll a double to start the game
